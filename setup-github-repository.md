# Creating and Pushing to a New GitHub Repository

To successfully push your code to GitHub, you'll need to follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner of the page
3. Select "New repository"
4. Enter the repository name: `mem0-ollama`
5. Add an optional description: "Web chat interface with mem0 integration for Ollama"
6. Choose the repository visibility (Public or Private)
7. **Important:** Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license file
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code to the New Repository

After creating the empty repository, you can run the PowerShell script to push your local code:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\create-new-github-repo.ps1
```

## Step 3: Verify Your Repository

1. After the script completes, go to https://github.com/KhryptorGraphics/mem0-ollama
2. Verify that all your files have been pushed correctly

**Note:** If you're using a different GitHub username, you'll need to modify the repository URL in the `create-new-github-repo.ps1` file before running it.
